# Lingusitics Intelligence Test, Personal Project
Used content validity to verify that the test measures different levels of linguistic intelligence. It presents several aspects of linguistics a person would encounter, such as grammar, vocabulary, rhetorical devices, tone analysis, and literary devices, with answers ranging from mastery to unfamiliarity.
Used an achievement test to measure what linguistic material a person has learned.
Tested reliability by having seven people take the test on two separate occasions and comparing their average scores.

Test scores on first occasion: 70, 64, 63, 60, 51, 48, 39: average 56.43

Test scores on second occasion: 71, 65, 61, 59, 52, 49, 40: average 56.71
